# Honesto

Application for internal company feedback.

## Future Improvements

If given a week instead of 2 days, this is what I would have done differently:

1. Move data to external database (mLab)
2. Build out the submission report page - make it more detailed and similar to what's in the mock.
3. Add progress indicator to the bottom of each question.
4. Add authentication and a login screen
5. Build out the My Feedback page
6. Add loading animations
7. Add "No Feedback" and 404 pages
8. Use styled components instead of vanilla.js
9. Refactor the QuestionContainer so that there's less boilerplate for the questions.

## End Result vs Initial Plan

Overall, the end result came pretty close that what I thought would be able to achieve in 2 days, and what we had discussed in the original design meeting. The only feature that I originally had planned to do but didn't get time to was the loading animations. The mocks and the design is clean and modern and that made development a lot easier and fun :)
